## Introduction

This repository is a collection of solutions to coding problems from **exercise.org**. Each solution is organized into separate folders by problem and contains the source code and corresponding test cases.

## Directory Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
EXERCISM/
├── python/
│   ├── guidos-gorgeous-lasagna/
│   ├── hello-world/
│   ├── isbn-verifier/
│   ├── meltdown-mitigation/
│   ├── perfect-numbers/
│   ├── pig-latin/
│   ├── rotational-cipher/

```

- **python/**: Contains the problem solutions implemented in Python.
    - Each folder within the `python/` directory represents a separate problem.
    - Files such as `README.md`, `HELP.md`, and `.exercism` provide problem context, helper functions, and configuration settings.
    - The source code (`*.py`) and test files (`*_test.py`) are included for each problem.

- **swift/**: Contains the problem solutions implemented in Swift.
    - Each folder within the `swift/` directory represents a separate problem.
    - Files such as `README.md`, `HELP.md`, and `.exercism` provide problem context, helper functions, and configuration settings.
    - The source code (`*.swift`) and test files (`*_test.swift`) are included for each problem.

## Problem Categories

The problems are organized into categories, each representing a specific problem or exercise.

- **Algorithms**: Various algorithmic challenges (e.g., `rotational-cipher`, `pig-latin`).
- **Mathematics & Numbers**: Mathematical problems (e.g., `perfect-numbers`).
- **String Manipulation**: String-related problems (e.g., `isbn-verifier`).
- **Miscellaneous**: Other problems that cover different domains (e.g., `meltdown-mitigation`, `triangle`).

## Languages Used

- **Python**: Majority of the solutions are in Python.
- **Swift**: Swift directory is prepared for future solutions.
